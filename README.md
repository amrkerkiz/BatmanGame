# BatmanGame
 This Batman 2d platform game was made during senior year of high school as one of the end of the year projects we had. It was a partner project and really introduced me to coding in pairs and how difficult it can be to code with another person. I was able to understand how effective communication was in order to organize our ideas, keep each other on the same board, and get the project done.

# Running the Project
In order to run the project, since it was made in BlueJ it has to be run in BlueJ, making sure to include the mayflower library in the project settings

# Project Functionalities
In this game, you play as batman, trying to get past as much enemies as you can, pressing the character z to attack. At the end of each stage there is a batman car that you can approach near to start the next cutscene and stage that are set up. The main mission is to defeat joker all the way at then end, and if you do he spawns infinite loot for you.
