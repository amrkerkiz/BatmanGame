# BatmanGame
 This Batman 2d platform game was made during senior year of high school as one of the end of the year projects we had. It was a partner project and really introduced me to coding in pairs and how difficult it can be to code with another person. I was able to understand how effective communication was in order to organize our ideas, keep each other on the same board, and get the project done.
